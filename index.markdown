Hello! I am a Junior Research Fellow in Theoretical Physics at Homerton College, University of Cambridge, based at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). My research focuses on numerical simulation of radiative signatures from cosmic (axion) strings using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). I am also a developer and user of [GRChombo](https://www.grchombo.org/), an open-source AMR code for numerical relativity.

My Homerton webpage is [here](https://www.homerton.cam.ac.uk/people/amelia-drew), and my DAMTP webpage [here](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/person/ad652).
